Hello!

Welcome to Eric Zhai's Summer 2019 Development Intern Challenge Solution

You can access the API and its documentation by running http://localhost:5000/ after running Main.py. Alternatively you can just open the html file in /templates to view the documentation.

The modules necessary to run the API can be found in modules.png.
